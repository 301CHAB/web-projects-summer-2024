    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>Walter Gropius, like his father and his great-uncle Martin Gropius before him, studied to became an architect. Gropius could not draw, and was dependent on collaborators and partner-architects throughout his career. In school he hired an assistant to complete his homework for him. In 1908, after studying architecture in Munich and Berlin for four semesters, Gropius joined the office of the renowned architect and industrial designer Peter Behrens, one of the first members of the utilitarian school. His fellow employees at this time included Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.</p>
    
    <h4>Early Career</h4>
    <p>In <time datetime="1910">1910</time> Gropius left the firm of Behrens and together with fellow employee Adolf Meyer established a practice in Berlin. Together they share credit for one of the seminal modernist buildings created during this period the Faguswerk in Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany, in <time datetime="1913">1913</time>. Although Gropius and Meyer only designed the facade, the glass curtain walls of this important and influential building was entirely their own. The work reflects functional concerns and Gropius emphasized both the economic principle which the factory was constructed and its "positive significance for the healthy monument of European economy."</p>
    
    <p>Gropius was drafted in the postwar period, <time datetime="1915">1915</time> and upon his return to Germany his acceptance into the labor union brought about a series of design commissions for him. By <time datetime="1919">1919</time> he was named to replace Henry Van de Velde as director of the Weimar School of Arts and Crafts and the school was renamed Bauhaus. Gropius's work with the Bauhaus earned him international fame and by <time datetime="1923">1923</time> he was able to transfer his school to a newly constructed facility designed in collaboration with Henry van de Velde in Dessau. In <time datetime="1928">1928</time> he handed over the direction of the Bauhaus to Hannes Meyer, Gropius's first significant hire. Gropius's influence continued until the school closed under pressure from the Nazi regime in <time datetime="1933">1933</time>.</p>
    
    <h4>Late Career in United States</h4>
    <p>The rise of Hitler in the <time datetime="1930">1930s</time> drove Gropius out of Germany. With the help of the English architect Maxwell Fry, Gropius was able to leave Nazi Germany in <time datetime="1934">1934</time>, on the pretext of making a temporary visit to Italy to attend the Triennale design festival; he then fled to Britain to avoid the fascist powers of Europe. He lived and worked in Britain as head of the Isokon group with Fry and others and then moved on to the United States with his family.</p>
    
    <p>Gropius and his Bauhaus protégé Marcel Breuer both moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) they taught architects in <time datetime="1937">1937</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1952">1952</time> and collaborate on projects including The Alan I. W. Frank House in Pittsburgh and the company-town Aluminum City Terrace project in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Before their professional split, in <time datetime="1938">1938</time> Gropius was appointed chairman of the Department of Architecture, a post he held until his retirement in <time datetime="1952">1952</time>. In <time datetime="1944">1944</time>, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.</p>
    
    <p>In <time datetime="1946">1946</time>, he founded the young architects' association, The Architects' Collaborative (TAC), a manifestation of his lifelong belief in the significance of teamwork, which he had already successfully introduced at the Bauhaus. Based in Cambridge, TAC's team included Norman C. Fletcher, Jean B. Fletcher, John C. Harkness, Sarah P. Harkness, Robert S. MacMillan, Louis A. McMillen, and Benjamin C. Thompson. On work produced by TAC under the directorship of Harvard University in Cambridge cited <time datetime="1949">1949</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1955">1955</time>. TAC would become one of the most well-known and respected architectural firms in the world before closing in 1995.</p>
    
    <p>Gropius continued to work for many years until his death in <time datetime="1969">1969</time>. He is remembered for the architectural landmarks in Europe and the United States, several of which continue to serve their original purpose to this day.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    
    <h4>Bauhaus</h4>

    <p>In this design, Walter Gropius refined architectural ideas that he first put into practice before WWI in the construction of the Fagus-Werk in Alfeld an der Leine. In Dessau as in Alfeld, the glass curtain wall suspended in front of the load-bearing framework defines the exterior of the workshop wing and openly shows the constructive elements. Gropius, rather than visually amplifying the corners of the cubing body of the building, allowed the glass surface to overlap the edges, thereby creating the impression of lightness.</p>
    
    <p>Gropius consistently separated the parts of the Bauhaus building according to their functions and designed each differently. The theory arranged the different wings asymmetrically &mdash; in relation to what is today the Bauhausstraße and the Gropiusallee respectively. In order to appreciate the overall design of the complex, the observer must therefore move around the whole building. There is no central viewpoint.</p>
    
    <p>The entire complex is rendered and painted mainly in light tones, creating an attractive contrast to the window frames, which are dark. For the interior, the junior master of the mural workshop, Hinnerk Scheper, designed a detailed color plan that, by differentiating between the supporting and masking elements through the use of color, aimed to accentuate the construction of the building.</p>

    <h5>Walter Gropius House</h5>

Boucher - Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) MAS,9-LIN,16-20</cite> date taken <time datetime="1960">1960</time></figcaption>
    <p>Working with local Concord, Massachusetts, builder Casper J. Jenney and approximately $20,000, Gropius designed the house to reflect its surroundings and so they traveled around the area to gain inspiration. The resulting building is constructed from local materials and elements of both traditional New England architecture such as clapboard, brick, and fieldstone, with new, innovative elements of design and architecture such as glass block, acoustical plaster, chrome, and steel. Much of the Bauhaus aesthetic is still present, such as the lighting, colors, and simplicity of the building. 
    <p>Among the features in the Gropius House are sourced from non-traditional and ordinary catalogs. For example, the hall sconces were ordered from second floor hall sconces and in each side of the house as mirrors. Each bathroom features unusual and modern fixtures like a heated towel rack to warm towels, bright colors, and integral white ceramic tile. The Gropius House has a finished basement and attic, one bedroom and two on the second floor; they all depended on hot air systems and the Gropius house had both efficiency and economy. Four bathrooms were located in the basement, the first floor and the second floor; the bathrooms are very important.</p>

    <blockquote>“As to my practice, when I built my first house in the U.S.A. &mdash; which was my own &mdash; I made it a point to absorb into my conception those features of the New England architectural tradition that I found still alive and adequate. This fusion of the regional spirit with an international approach produced a house that I would never have built except with a conviction born of both knowledge, technical and psychological background." &mdash; Walter Gropius, Scope of Total Architecture, <time datetime="1956">1956</time></blockquote>
    
    <h5>MetLife Building</h5>

    <p>The MetLife Building is a 59-story skyscraper at 200 Park Avenue at East 45th Street above Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Built in <time datetime="1958">1958</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1963">1963</time> as the Pan Am Building, the headquarters of Pan American World Airways, it was designed by Emery Roth & Sons with Walter Gropius and Pietro Belluschi, both masters of the International style. The world's largest commercial office space as judged by square footage at its opening, it remains one of the hundred tallest buildings in the United States.</p>
    
    <p>When it opened on <time datetime="1963-03-07">March 7, 1963</time>, the Pan Am Building (as it was known at the time) was the largest commercial office space in the world by square footage. It was initially an unpopular sight due to its lack of proportion and huge scale: it dwarfed the New York Central Building to the north and Grand Central Terminal to the south. The building was surpassed in size by the World Trade Center in <time datetime="1970">1970</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1971">1971</time> as well as 55 Water Street in <time datetime="1972">1972</time>.</p>
